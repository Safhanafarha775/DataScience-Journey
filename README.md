# Data Science Projects

Welcome to my Data Science portfolio! ðŸš€  
This repository is a collection of my projects where I explore datasets, apply machine learning, and build insights through data analysis and visualization.  

## ðŸ“Œ Contents
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** â€“ Handling missing values, outliers, and feature engineering.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€“ Visualizing datasets to find hidden patterns.  
- **Machine Learning Models** â€“ Building predictive models using regression, classification, and clustering.  
- **Deep Learning (Upcoming)** â€“ Experiments with neural networks and AI-based solutions.  
- **Capstone Projects** â€“ End-to-end projects on real-world datasets.  

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- SQL  
- Machine Learning & AI concepts  

## ðŸŒŸ Goal
This repository is a reflection of my journey in Data Science.  
I aim to keep updating it with new projects as I grow in the field.
